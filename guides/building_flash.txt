##  1. Configure your environment  ##

#####################################

In order to compile this kernel, you will need a Linux environment.
If you can't dual boot, use Virtual Box to create a virtual machine
(I did it with Mint 18, images below). To get the environment configured, e
ither use Google's own guide (https://source.android.com/source/initializing.html)
or my guide (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathanchance/Android-Tools/master/Building_AOSP.txt)



##########################
##                      ##
##  2. Grab the source  ##
##                      ##
##########################

1. Grab my Flash source

Format:
$ mkdir ~/Android
$ cd ~/Android
$ git clone https://github.com/nathanchance/angler.git Flash

Explanation:
-- First command makes a directory named Android in your home folder
   (mkdir = make directory). You can change the location if you want
   but keep it consistent throughout the guide.
-- Second command moves into that directory (change directory)
-- Third command pulls the source from my Github into a directory named
   Flash (git clone <url> <folder_to_clone_in_to> is the format of the command)


2. Grab my AnyKernel2 source

Format:
$ cd ~/Android
$ git clone https://github.com/nathanchance/AnyKernel2.git Flash-AK2

Explanation:
-- First command moves into that directory (change directory)
-- Second command pulls the AnyKernel repo from my Github into a directory named
   Flash-AK2 (git clone <url> <folder_to_clone_in_to> is the format of the command)


3. Grab the toolchain you want to use to compile the kernel

Format:
$ cd ~/Android
$ git clone -b personal-linaro-7.x https://github.com/nathanchance/gcc-prebuilts aarch64-linaro-linux-gnu

Explanation:
- In order to compile the kernel, we need to grab a toolchain (bunch of
   compilation tools). I currently use my own toolchain, based on Uber. This will
   download and checkout the toolchain like above.

##  3. Setup the build  ##
##                      ##
##########################

1. Make sure everything looks right

-- After following the above steps, type:
   $ ls

-- You should see something like this:
   aarch64-linaro-linux-gnu  Flash  Flash-AK2


2. Select the correct AnyKernel branch

Format:
$ cd ~/Android/Flash-AK
$ git checkout <branch>

Example:
$ cd ~/Android/Flash-AK
$ git checkout angler-flash-public-7.1.2

Explanation:
-- First command will move you into the AnyKernel2 source directory we cloned above.
-- Second command will checkout the branch you want to use. You can see the list
   of branches by typing git branch -av.

##  4. Make the kernel  ##
##                      ##
##########################

1. Tell the makefile what toolchain and architecture you are building for

   1. Figure out the full path of your toolchain folder

   Assuming you have done this whole process correctly, you can move
   into your toolchain directory and type:
   $ cd ~/Android/aarch64-linaro-linux-gnu
   $ pwd

   You should get something like this: /home/nathan/Android/aarch64-linaro-linux-gnu


   2. Tell the compiler where that toolchain is

   Copy and paste that file location above into this command:
   $ export CROSS_COMPILE=<toolchain_dir>/bin/aarch64-linaro-linux-gnu-

   Example:
   $ export CROSS_COMPILE=/home/nathan/Android/aarch64-linaro-linux-gnu/bin/aarch64-linaro-linux-gnu-


   3. Set the architecture

   Angler is a 64-bit device so we need arm64
   $ export ARCH=arm64 && export SUBARCH=arm64


2. Clean up from a previous compilation and update the source

$ cd ~/Android/Flash
$ git clean -f -d -x > /dev/null 2>&1
$ git fetch origin
$ git reset --hard origin/7.1.2-flash

-- The first command moves you into the Flash source directory.
-- The second command will clean any untracked or compiled files (this is send
   to /dev/null so you do not see it happen).
-- The third and fourth command will pull any new kernel changes from me into the source.


3. Set up the defconfig

A defconfig tells the compiler which features you want in the kernel.
This is already set up by me. To set up the defconfig, type the following:
$ cd ~/Android/Flash
$ mkdir out
$ make O=out flash_defconfig


4. Make the kernel!

Format:
$ make O=out -j$( nproc --all )

##  5. Zip it up and flash!  ##
##                           ##
###############################

1. Clean the AnyKernel directory

Format:
$ cd ~/Android/Flash-AK2
$ git clean -f -d -x > /dev/null 2>&1
$ git fetch origin
$ git reset --hard origin/<anykernel_branch>


Example:
$ cd ~/Android/Flash-AK2
$ git clean -f -d -x > /dev/null 2>&1
$ git fetch origin
$ git reset --hard origin/angler-flash-public-7.1.2


-- The first command moves you into the AnyKernel source directory.
-- The second command will clean any untracked or compiled files (this is send
   to /dev/null so you do not see it happen).
-- The third and fourth command will pull any new repo changes from me into the source.


2. Copy the zImage to the AnyKernel directory

Format:
$ cp -v ~/Android/Flash/out/arch/arm64/boot/Image.gz-dtb ~/Android/Flash-AK2

Explanation:
-- We need to copy the newly compiled kernel (which resides in the
   arch/arm64/boot folder) to the AnyKernel directory, while changing its
   name to zImage-dtb.
-- cp = copy
-- -v = verbose (prints the copying)
-- ~/Android/Flash/out/arch/arm64/boot/Image.gz-dtb = file to be copied
-- ~/Android/Flash-AK2 = destination

2. Zip it up!

Format:
$ cd ~/Android/Flash-AK2
$ zip -r9 flash-kernel.zip * -x README flash-kernel.zip

Explanation:
-- Using the above commands, your newly completed kernel will be
   located at ~/Android/Flash-AK2/flash-kernel.zip

If you followed all of the above steps successfully, congratulations, you built
the kernel!! Once you have done all five steps, you will just need to follow
steps 4 and 5 to update in the future. Below, I have linked a script that will
do all of this for you (with some variable edits at the top); however, please do
it manually first so you know exactly what you are doing :) enjoy!

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathanchance/Android-Tools/master/Scripts/build-flash.sh

Below are screenshots of me doing this process in a virtual machine (Arch Linux)
with 2 cores, 4GB of RAM, and 60GB of storage on my MacBook with a 2.5 GHz Intel
Core i5 and 8GB of RAM (fairly average in the world of PC specs I think).
It's totally possible to do this on your own.
